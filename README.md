# NASA-SPACE-APPS-CHALLANGE
While NASAâ€™s space probe Juno orbits the planet Jupiter and its moons, its visible-light camera, JunoCam, captures dazzling views of the Jovian system in spectacular detail. Your challenge is to create innovative ways to process JunoCam raw images for scientific, artistic, or other fun purposes.

our challenge is to develop an open-source image-editing application (or other free alternative) to develop color images using the three JunoCam-generated grayscale images representing the RGB colors. Experiment with image processing to generate images that can be used for scientific, artistic, or other fun activities. Some of these images may even lead to new scientific discoveries!
